# Dashboard

This is a dashboard to use with a space shuttle flight following [shuttle-command](http://gh.jwronline.be/shuttle-command/) and [jwr-shuttle](https://github.com/jwronline/jwr-shuttle) for scripts.

Inspired by NASA's [MCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr._Mission_Control_Center)

# Usage

Each click, spacebar, arrow down, arrow right, enter advances.

Each right click, arrow up, arrow left, backspace goes back a step.

Right now stages and configurations aren't yet implemented

# Contributing

Right now this is a shell of what it could become, it can use real data, more variable data and more configuring. It should also in long term be connected to what the players see and enter on their consoles.
